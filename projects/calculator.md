summary: "A Stacked-Based Calculator I developed in ICS 211."
---

A stacked-based calculator I developed as an assignment in ICS 211, Spring 2024. In this program, I learned how to use stack data structures to process basic mathematical operations while also handling mathematical errors and syntax errors. 

This program had to be done in a week in [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/) using Java. A few key features that I now have an uderstanding of is <b>Push</b>, adding an item to the top of the stack, and <b>Pop</b>, removing and returning the item at the top of the stack. 

Here is an example code of how the Push and Pop methods were used the Stacked-Based Calculator:
