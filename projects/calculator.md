A Stacked-Based Calculator I developed as an assignment in ICS 211, Spring 2024. In this program, I learned how to use stack data structures to process basic mathematical operations while also handling mathematical errors and syntax errors. 

This program had to be done in a week in [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/) using Java. A few key features that I now have an uderstanding of is Push, adding an item to the top of the stack, and Pop, removing and returning the item at the top of the stack. 

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
