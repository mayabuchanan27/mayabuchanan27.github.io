I developed a Java Swing account balance calculator in ICS 211, Spring 2024. 

I developed an account balance calculator in ICS 211, Spring 2024. This program uses Java Swing framework to create a user friendly GUI in order to calculate and display the monthly account balance over a 12-month period.

The user is able to input their own initial amount, yearly interest rate, and monthly payment. Through basic calculations, the user is able to see their account balance throughout the year.
