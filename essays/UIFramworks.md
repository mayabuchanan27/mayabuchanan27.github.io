UI frameworks, such as Bootstrap 5, have been very useful in helping me learn the aspects of web design. Bootstrap 5 is a front-end framework that provides pre-designed UI components and styling utilities, improving both the efficiency and speed of website development. Additionally, Bootstrap 5 simplifies the styling process by allowing developers to use predefined CSS classes directly in the HTML file, making it easier to design and customize sections without writing extensive custom CSS.

Since this was my first time working with a UI framework, I found it to be highly beneficial and a great introduction to structured web design. Before using Bootstrap 5, I had to manually write in the CSS for every element in my HTML, which made my ability to construct websites very limited. With Bootstrap 5, I was able to use the different classes that the framework gives to style elements such as buttons, navigation bars, and images. Instead of spending time adjusting margins, paddings, and font styles for every element, I could apply a simple class like <b>container</b> to instantly structure my layout in a more organized way. This allowed me to focus more on the functionality and structure of my web pages rather than spending excessive time fixing individual styles.

Overall, if I were to choose between using UI frameworks or sticking with plain HTML and CSS, I would choose to use UI frameworks. While writing plain HTML and CSS provides full control over every aspect of a website, it can be incredibly time-consuming and repetitive, whereas Bootstrap 5 simplifies this process significantly. The most difficult part I encountered while using Bootstrap 5 was learning how to connect different classes cohesively within the HTML file. Since there are many classes with different functions, it took time to understand how they interacted with one another and how to properly structure them for a clean and functional layout. However, with continued practice and learning, I am becoming more comfortable with linking classes to create an appealing website. I look forward to further developing my skills in UI frameworks and enhancing my web design capabilities.
