## My Future Goals
In the future, I hope to refine my skills in programming languages such as Python, Java, TypeScript, and C++ through more ICS classes and collaborative projects. I aim to gain experience in creating software applications, with a focus on developing tools that are both user-friendly and efficient. My interest in indigenous AI drives me to learn more about machine learning, natural language processing, and ethical AI development. Specifically, I am looking to explore how AI can be used to preserve and promote the Hawaiian language, knowledge, and traditions, ensuring that technological advancements are accessible to Hawaiians.

Ultimately, I aspire to become a software engineer who uses modern technology to one day make a meaningful impact. Whether itâ€™s designing applications that are used for everyday tasks or advancing indigenous AI to celebrate cultural diversity, I am committed to continuously learning and evolving in this dynamic field. My journey in software engineering is driven by a passion for innovation, problem-solving, and creating tools that reflect and respect the richness of human experiences.
