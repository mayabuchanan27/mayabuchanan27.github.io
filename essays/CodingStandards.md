## The Balance of Functionality and Readability 
Every time I worked on a program, my main goal was to get the code to work. When frustration was mixed in with the difficult challenges I would run into, my code did not look as efficient as it should have. I would sometimes get lazy and fix all of the incorrect formatting after I compile and have a running code. Unfortunately, this means that I cared more about functionality of the program even if it was a little unreadable. However, getting into the habit of using coding standards has allowed me to realize the importance of having a clean and organized code. 

## ESLint Is Worth It!

To improve my coding standards, I was introduced to the extension [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) in VSCode. Setting up the extension was probably the most difficult part. I probably spent a good amount of trying to fix the errors I was encountering. I eventually decided to reinstall VSCode because ESLint may have been having problems with my previously installed extensions. After completing the whole process for a third time, I was finally able to see the value of having an extension, like ESLint, to help with coding standards.

Initially, I felt like ESLint was being annoyingly picky because it marked every tiny mistake. However, after using it for a while, I began to see its advantages. It helped me catch small bugs early, making the coding process manageable as well as preventing issues that could have been harder to debug later. It also allows for consistent formatting throughout the code, which not only makes it easier for me to read, but also those who might look at my work as well. Overall, using ESLint showed the benefits of applying coding standards to write and produce an efficient professional program.
