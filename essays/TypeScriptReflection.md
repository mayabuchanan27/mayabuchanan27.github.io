## Being a Beginner to TypeScript
Learning Typescript has been both challenging and insightful so far. Coming from previous courses that were heavily based in Java, Javascript or C, getting to understand TypeScript was not easy at first. Since this language is new to me, I would often mix it up with Java or JavaScript when I was practicing, which made TypeScript even more confusing. However, after getting to learn the basics and practicing in the TypeScript Playground, I have grown a little bit more comfortable with its syntax and features. I find that the TypeScript error messages clearly helped me understand what errors I encountered, which provided me with information on how to fix my code.

Despite being new to Typescript, I intend to have a growth mindset and learn from the challenges that I will encounter. From this class, I hope to continue to develop a foundation in TypeScript so that I can further my knowledge and understanding in software engineering. Getting to understand TypeScript will also help me with projects in this class and future projects in my career.

## The Pressure of WODs
Athletic software engineering and the WODs (workout of the day) are also very new to me. I am very used to taking my time with assignments by completing them in sections over the course of a week. However, these timed exercises have taught me to push myself to solve problems somewhat quickly while maintaining code quality. Although the time for the WODs are very limited, the WODs are incredibly helpful in identifying the material that I have a grasp on and the material that I need to improve on. Ultimately, I hope to gain more experience from these WODs since it simulates how developers are able to work under an insane amount of pressure.
