## The Balance of Functionality and Readability 
Imagine having all the materials to build a house except for a blueprint. Thatâ€™s how software feels without design patterns: fragile, inconsistent, and hard to scale. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems, much like architectural plans that guide the structure of a building. They help developers organize code, avoid repetition, and communicate ideas more clearly.

## My experience
In the six-part Digits assignment, I learned about the Factory pattern. I used it to return the correct React component depending on the type of digit being displayed. Instead of writing long chains of conditional logic, I created a single function that took a digit type and returned either the edit, add, admin, etc. component. It made the code much easier to read, maintain, and extend later into the later parts of the assignment.
