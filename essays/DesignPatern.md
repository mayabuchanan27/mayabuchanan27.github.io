## All Houses Need A Blueprint 
Imagine having all the materials to build a house except for a blueprint. Thatâ€™s how software feels without implementing design patterns. Looking at code without design patterns, it would be very inconsistent and be very difficult to read due to it being unorganized. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems, much like architectural plans that guide the structure of a building. They help developers organize code, avoid repetition, and communicate ideas more clearly.

## My Experience
In the six-part Digits assignment, I learned about the Factory pattern. I used it to return the correct React component depending on the type of card that was to be displayed. Instead of writing long chains of conditional statements, I created a single function that took a type and returned either the edit, add, admin, etc. component. It made the code much easier to read and extend later into the later parts of the assignment.
