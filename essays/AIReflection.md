## Introduction
The role of AI in education has become increasingly prominent in recent years, especially in technical fields like software engineering. This is largely because AI allows students to learn more quickly and efficiently. In software engineering, AI is capable of explaining unfamiliar concepts, pointing out mistakes in code, and offering suggestions that help work progression. However, this makes it possible for students to limit their learning experience by taking advantage of using AI. Throughout my experience in ICS 314, I gradually found myself turning to AI tools, such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, not just as a last resort, but as a consistent part of my learning process.

## Personal Experience with AI
### In-class Practice WODs / In-class WODs
WODs, or Workout Of the Day, was definitely the most challenging assignment of this class for me. To prepare for them we were given practice WODs. During these practices, I would use ChatGPT to explain new concepts or to give a step by step guide on how to install certain tools on VSCode. I remember having such a hard time getting my ESLint to install properly that by the time I got to the WOD practice, I still could not get it to download. So, I asked ChatGPT, “*Could you provide a guide to installing ESLint in VSCode?*” The response I got was five steps that included detailed instructions: Install, Initialize, Set up, Enable, and Test. Even though I did not finish the WOD practice, I was still impressed that I was able to fix my struggle with ESLint using ChatGPT and I was able to begin learning about coding standards. When it came time to take the In-class WODs, most of the time I felt prepared from the In-class practice WODs and homework experiences. I also wanted to take the opportunity to see how much I gained from each lesson, rather than relying on AI to complete the entire WOD for me. However, if I struggled with errors I had not encountered before or if I was too lazy to fix ESLint errors myself, I would turn to GitHub Copilot because it would generate an explanation and solution and apply it to my code within seconds. Since the WODs were based on completing an assignment in a given time, Github Copilot allowed me to save a lot of time while also keeping the quality of my code up to standards. 

### Essays
When writing essays, in my opinion, using AI was not necessary for me. Without AI, I am able to clearly express my thoughts and challenge myself to use my knowledge on how to write an essay. The farthest I will go to use AI in my essays is using Grammarly to check my grammatical errors and improve the overall clarity of my essay. Furthermore, when writing essays on my experiences in this class, I feel like it was important for myself to reflect on what I have learned and using AI would not benefit my learning experience in that area. 

### Final project
For the final project, my group created a system that allows UH students to make reservations at the courts in the recreation center for either basketball or volleyball. One of my tasks was to turn the basketball and volleyball schedules into html. Based on my team memberʻs drawing, I needed to figure out a way to make an evenly spaced table and to get the data rows to be filled with “Free” or reservation data. I started off by asking ChatGPT, “*How would I create a simple 2x2 table in Next.js for the purpose of a schedule?*” The response was very clear in providing code that I was able to build off of in the final look of the webpage. 

### Learning a Concept / Tutorial
Using AI to learn new concepts or walk through tutorials was one of the most effective ways for me to understand the material better. When I struggled with a topic, I would ask ChatGPT to break it down step-by-step or explain it in simpler terms. This helped reinforce what I learned in class and gave me additional perspectives that clarified the material that was new to me.

### Answering a Question in Class or in Discord
Using AI to answer a question in class or on Discord is something that hadn’t occurred to me at the time. I typically relied on my own understanding when responding to others because in the moment it feels  a little more natural. However, thinking about it now, AI could have been a helpful resource to double-check my answers or provide a clearer explanation before responding.

### Asking or Answering a Smart-Question
If I was struggling to clearly formulate a question, I would use ChatGPT to help refine it. I’d explain what I was trying to ask, and it would generate a more structured and understandable version of the question. This helped me communicate more effectively when asking for help in class.
Coding example / Explaining code
Using AI to show examples of code and to explain code was common for me to use during experiences. I spent the majority of my time using AI asking questions about code in the React experiences. For example, I asked to provide examples of code that showed different ways to get an image to be the background and an explanation of the differences. 

### Writing Code
I occasionally used AI as a starting point when writing code, especially for repetitive patterns or when I was stuck. For example, like I stated in my final project, I asked ChatGPT for help structuring a React component to display a weekly schedule. It gave me a working template, which I then adjusted to meet the specific requirements of the project. It helped speed up the initial phase, but it also allowed me to be involved in the process to further my own understanding of the code. 

### Documenting Code
I never thought of using AI to document my code, but I feel like this would have benefitted my code to be more clear to whoever is reading it. 

### Quality Assurance 
Using AI for quality assurance was very common for me to use because I ran into confusing and complex problems a lot. Whether it was an ESLint error I didn’t fully understand or unexpected behavior in a React component, I would copy the error message and relevant code into ChatGPT and ask for help. For example, I once asked, “*What’s causing this ESLint warning about missing dependencies?*” ChatGPT explained the concept clearly and showed how to fix it. This saved me a lot of time and helped me understand how to avoid similar issues in the future.

### Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
One way I used AI that wasn’t listed above was during the experience where we had to recreate an existing website of our choosing. I used ChatGPT to identify the exact fonts and color schemes used on the original site. I provided the URL and asked, “*What font and color codes does this website use?*” and the response was surprisingly accurate. This saved me a lot of time and helped ensure that my redesign closely matched the original site’s visual style.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding 
The use of AI into my learning process in ICS 314 had a significant impact on how I approached coding, problem-solving, and understanding course material. AI helped me comprehend difficult concepts more efficiently, especially when experiences or in-class WODs left me completely lost. It was particularly useful for reinforcing new topics by breaking them down in simpler terms and offering examples. Because of this, I made an effort not to rely on AI to generate complete, copy-and-paste solutions. I feel like copying full blocks of code without understanding them wasn’t beneficial to my learning. Instead, I focused on using AI to guide me through problems while developing my own critical thinking skills. Ultimately, my use in AI enhanced my understanding when I used it as a support tool rather than a replacement for learning.

## Practical Applications
Outside of ICS 314 and software engineering, AI has been helpful for me in calculus and sustainability classes for similar reasons. 
Challenges and Opportunities
While AI can be a helpful tool, I also found that it limits the learning experience if it is relied on too heavily. One challenge I faced was the temptation to let AI do all the work for me when I was stuck on a problem for a time. It was easy to ask ChatGPT for a solution, but I realized that I wouldnʻt be learning if I was given a complete answer. The opportunity to use AI should be implemented as a source of guidance like in my responses stated above. 

## Comparative Analysis
In the context of software engineering development, both traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches have their benefits. Traditional teaching provides more of a structure and mentorship in real time. It also helps build foundational skills through hands-on practice and peer collaboration projects, which are essential for long-term growth in the industry. On the other hand, AI tools offer flexibility and immediate feedback, allowing students to experiment and troubleshoot at their own pace. While AI can quickly fill in gaps in understanding, it often lacks the depth and understanding that a human instructor can provide. When used together, these two approaches complement each other and create a more complete learning experience.

## Future Considerations
In the future, AI software engineering will play a much bigger role. In my opinion, AI will definitely advance and will be better integrated into learning the foundation of software engineering, which will only challenge students more to focus on their own learning to develop a strong skill set on the material. 

## Conclusion 
Ultimately, my journey in ICS 314 has shown me that while AI is a useful tool, real growth happens through active engagement, persistence, and hands-on problem solving, especially in the WODs. With the right balance, AI can enhance learning, improve efficiency, and help students like me become more confident and capable developers.
