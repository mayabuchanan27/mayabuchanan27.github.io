## Creating Effort Estimations 
I made my effort estimates based on the difficulty of the task, how I would complete previous tasks, or if I am able to complete the task in one or multiple sittings. Additionally, I alotted myself a decent amount of time if I knew I had to do some research. In one case, since I knew that I was going to be making two of the same html schedule page, I focused on the basketball page first. Once that was done, I estimated only 10 minutes for the volleyball version because it involved mostly duplicating the existing file and changing labels from "basketball" to "volleyball." On the other hand, when I worked on the Playwright tests, I expected backend issues, so I estimated a longer time knowing Iâ€™d run into debugging challenges.

# Tracking Effort Estimations
To track my coding estimations, I set a timer with the amount of time and if I had not completed the task, I would add ten more minutes. If I was doing research I would set a stop-watch to take the pressure off of the coding efforts. If I were to step aside and take a break from coding I would pause my timer so that it wouldn't interfere with the estimations. I think my tracking method is sort of accurate mostly because I used two seperate clocks, rather than just logging everything on one clock. There was actually one time where I completely forgot to pause my timer and ended up having to make a guess on how long I took a break for, but overall I believe as though my tracking is as accuarate as I could have gotten it to be. There was a normal amount of overhead when I was working on my project, which is what I expected and it didn't significantly effect my workflow  

# My Overal Experience with Effort Estimation 
There were definetly clear benefits to effort estimation, such as setting goals for tasks in order to stay organized and priotitize tasks. Estimations also helped our team balance the task workload across members and allowed us to think about the scope of the task before beginning it. Tracking actual effort gave me a better understanding of how I work and where my time actually goes. I learned that I often underestimate how long debugging issues takes. However, I do feel like there was a downside for estimating and tracking the time of my coding tasks. This is because I felt a little pressured if I knew that I was not going to make the time limit. In the beginning, I would end up rushing to beat the clock, causing the quality of my code to not be as great. Eventually, I adjusted and treated the estimates more like flexible guidelines than strict deadlines.
