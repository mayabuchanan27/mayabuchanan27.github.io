## Introduction 

Although my time in ICS 314 Software Engineering focused heavily on building web applications, it introduced me to core software engineering principles that apply far beyond websites. Three key concepts that stood out to me were User Interface Frameworks, Design Patterns, and Coding Standards. Each of these concepts shaped the way I think about building, organizing, and maintaining software systems that are not just focused on web devlopments, but potentially any kind of technical project.

### UI Frameworks
In my understanding, User Interface (UI) Frameworks help developers build organized and reusable front-end components. In this course, we used React, a JavaScript-based framework that promotes building UIs as a collection of independent, modular pieces. What I found most valuable wasnâ€™t just the convenience, but also the mindset it taught. React encourages separating logic from presentation and thinking in terms of components, which allowed me to understand that it makes the codebase easier to manage, update, and scale. Using a UI framework in this course helped me understand how structure and design principles can contribute to long-term software quality that can be applied to my future projects outside of web development . 

### Design Patterns
A Design Pattern, to me, is basically a solution to a common problem in software design. In one of our assignments, Digits, I used the Factory Pattern to choose and show the correct React component. Rather than using a long list of if or switch statements to figure out which component to show, I wrote a single function that took a type and returned the correct component. This made the code easier to read and test. Ultimately, using a pattern like this helps keep projects organized, especially as they grow. Outside of web development, the Design Patterns can be used in any software project to determine what action to take based on the input. From this course, I am now prepared to learn more Design Patterns to better understand how to handle problems in software engineering. 

### Coding Standards
Coding Standards is something that I have really come to appreciate in this course. At first, I did have a hard time understanding its importance and how I would benefit from it. However, I soon realized that Coding Standards are rules that are meant to keep code consistent and clean in order for it to be readable to others. In this course, ESLint was the main tool that I used to follow Coding Standards. By using this, it became especially important when working on group projects, where multiple people are reading and editing the same files. Over time, I also found that following coding standards made my own code easier to revisit and debug. I have even started applying these habits in my other courses to keep my assignments more organized and readable. Therefore, what seemed like strict rules at first turned out to be valuable habits that make me a more thoughtful and professional developer. 

## Conclusion 
Even though this course focused mainly on web development, ICS 314 helped me understand how many of its concepts can be applied in more ways. The material that was taught in this class serves to be my foundation in being a software engineer. Overall, I enjoyed the challenges that I overcame in this class and I look forward to applying what I have learned in my future courses.
