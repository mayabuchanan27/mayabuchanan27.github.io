## Inspiration and My Challenges in Computer Science
Growing up, my brothers and I spent much of our time playing sports both indoors and outdoors. However, during our free time, we bonded over competitive video games, particularly those related to sports. While gaming was a fun, engaging activity that bonded me and my brothers together, it also sparked my curiosity about the underlying technology behind it. I became fascinated by how software could create immersive digital experiences, leading me to explore programming and the broader field of software engineering when I was in high school. 

My first year studying computer science in college was both challenging and eye-opening, which is what I had expected. There were moments when I struggled to understand complex concepts, and at times, I even considered changing my major. However, despite these difficulties, I remained committed to pushing through and expanding my knowledge in computer science. I realized that the challenges I faced were part of the learning process, and rather than seeing them as obstacles, I embraced them as opportunities for growth. Now, in my second year, I am more confident in my abilities and I am also eager to gain hands-on experience through research opportunities that will allow me to explore the very curiosities that first inspired me as a child.

## Passion for Software Engineering and Future Goals
Software engineering interests me because it allows me to use both creativity and logic to create innovative solutions in modern technology. My main interests are in programming, software development, and indigenous artificial intelligence (AI). Programming and software development allows me to turn abstract ideas into functional applications that could possibly be applicable in everyday life. Recently, I have been interested in learning more about indigenous AI, as it represents an opportunity to create technology that respects and incorporates diverse cultural perspectives, such as my Hawaiian background, in order to offer unique and inclusive solutions. My interest in indigenous AI allows me to learn more about machine learning, natural language processing, and ethical AI development. Specifically, I am looking to explore how AI can be used to preserve and promote the Hawaiian language, knowledge, and traditions, ensuring that technological advancements are accessible to Hawaiians.

Ultimately, I aspire to become a software engineer who uses modern technology to one day make a meaningful impact. In the future, I hope to refine my skills in programming languages such as Python, Java, TypeScript, and C++ through more ICS classes and collaborative projects. I aim to gain experience in creating software applications, with a focus on developing tools that are both user-friendly and efficient. Whether it’s designing applications that are used for everyday tasks or advancing indigenous AI to celebrate cultural diversity, I hope that I can learn and evolve in this dynamic field. My journey in software engineering is just starting and I can’t wait to see how I apply the material that I gain to future projects and career.
